This is a program for downloading transcripts for video lectures available on YouTube. I have intentionally added some attributes but not used them, so as to use this module as a learning medium for web scraping.

Requirements:
You need to have Python and BeautifulSoup package installed

Running Instruction:
Simply run the program and choose from the lists shown as instructed.
If the course is available on the website but does not appear in the list, uncomment the 'update' function. It will update the list of courses and links and write them on the disk, to make the process faster. Afterwards you do not need to run 'update'.
